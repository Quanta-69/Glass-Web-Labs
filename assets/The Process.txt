Alright...These are the ideas that guide the creation of Glass Web Labs (GWL)

There are PAGES and there are SECTIONS

I'm making this site in such a way that almost everything is a component and can be edited without affecting the other parts of the site.

I mean...PAGES are MADE up of SECTIONS...this means that all sections will be made as separate components in the components folder and this folder contains sub-folders that carry the names of the PAGES they represent.

These SECTIONS will now be imported into the PAGES which are in the pages folder of the project.

By doing this, We can easily add or remove sections anytime without disrupting the normal flow of the website
