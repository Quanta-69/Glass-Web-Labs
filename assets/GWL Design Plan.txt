GWL is exactly like the previous Gecko Web Labs project but this time it has it's design changed.
The initial idea is still the same. Only design was changed.
The reason for this change in deign is to cut production time.
A site made with glassmorphism will be done faster than a normal site with animations and other features.

Glass Web Labs is design to use the glassmorphism design...
Using the blur filter in css and making the divs transparent wll create a glass effect on the site.
That is basically the principle guiding the GWL project design.
